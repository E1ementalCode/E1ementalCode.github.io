            <p>Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of timing working on personal or school-related projects, especially involving games. My projects focus primarly on the scripting aspect rather than design and often use Unity or Roblox Studio as a primary game engine. If you would like to view them or play them yourself, there will be links to each game at the beginning of each section. I will also go into depth about development, software, and content for each game. It is also important to note that I like to focus on the programming and functionality side of games. As a result, many of my games will have a simple asthetic to them or may still have some features that need to be worked on.</p>

            <p>RNG Fights is my second attempt at making an actual Roblox Game. Inspired by a few games I have seen on the platform, as well as a rise in the RNG (random number generation) genre on Roblox. I wanted to create a fighting game that was completely random in as many ways possible. In this game, you roll a variety of attacks that come in a range of rarities. The rarer the attack, the stronger it is. You can roll a common attack, for example Punch which is 1 in 3, that will deal very little damage and will most likely end up with you dead, or you can roll an extremely rare attack, for example Divinity with 1 in 500, that will instantly kill anyone you touch. Furthermore, rarer attacks will start server events that let you dominate the server. Now these attacks are very rare to roll, so in order to increase your chances, RNG Fights has an ingame currency that lets you purchase upgrades that provide benefits such as luck increases or faster cooldowns. There are also quests or challenges for you to complete to further increase your luck. These upgrades will also save across servers and gives the player a goal to work towards. As of right now, there are currently over 16 unique attacks in the game, each with their own aura and mechanics.</p>
            <p>RNG Fights is fairly new, only being created in March of 2024. Despite this, the game has gained a large amount of players and has seen an increase in playtime 3 months after the game was released to the public. This was my first time ever having a game blow up to the point where there was always 1,000 people playing and I felt like I was living my dream. As a consequence of the increase in players, however, a large amount of hackers started playing the game and bugs started to become a lot more common. In response, I have put a lot more time and focus into this game and have introduced a new anti-cheat, data saving system, and measures to ensure the game functions properly for everyone. I am also making sure to introduce new content to the game every week to keep the game feeling fresh. RNG Fights has taught me a lot about game development and is my first real experience with managing an active player base. Even though it was overwhelming at first, I am very greatful for the game's success.</p>
            <p><strong>Things I learned:</strong> combat mechanics, visual design, cybersecurity, data management</p>

            <p>Ultimate Boss Fight was my first major project made with Unity. The goal was simple: create a boss fight that would be challenging and would rely on player input. The boss (a big purple orb in the middle of the map) has a variety of attacks and a number of phases, each phase having faster and more dangerous attacks. The player would be equipped with a laser rifle and would be tasked with defeating the boss using their newfound weapon. Furthermore, two seperate difficulties provide different intensities and the progressively-difficult attacks make it a fun but challenging experience. An example of one of these attacks is the laser tracker. At first, the attack will have a long cooldown time and will appear a bright pink colour, giving the player plenty of time to react. This will drastically change as the fight goes on as by the final phase, the laser will have very little cooldown time, the charge up sound will be sped up, and the following explosion will give players a very small window to escape. With each attack following a similar mechanic and other features that help make the fight more enjoyable, I personally think this is one of my favourite projects. Despite the lower visual quality of the game, I still had a lot of fun making it and learned a lot of important skills, such as modularity. I also feel that it was a good introduction to game development with Unity as it helped me learn more about the C# language and the basic functions of the engine. It also acted as my first major step into developing games from scratch. Everything found inside the game, aside from the music and a few sound effects, were made within Unity myself. However, I do feel like I could definately make something better now and I have considered making a remastered version. It could potentially be another project I pursue in the future.</p>
            <p><strong>Things I learned:</strong> modular scripting, progressive functions, collision detection</p>

            <p>Classic Survival is another Roblox game that I have made recently and was my first ever attempt at an actual game. Going into the project, I didn't have much knowledge or experience with the Roblox engine or Lua language, however it has helped me learn Lua at a rapid pace in the span of just a few months. The game orientates around a randomly-generated world, very similar to that of Minecraft, where you gather resources and craft tools. The game is very basic and there is no clear end goal. Sometimes, me and my friends join just to have fun, whether through building something or testing out new updates. As of right now, I haven't released an update in a few months as I have been focusing on other things. In the background, however, I have been working on a reimagined version of the game that improves upon many major aspects of the game. Due to RNG Fights' recent popularity spike and other things I have been working on, I haven't been able to get the new version out or spend much time working on it, but it will always remain as something I can do when I have some extra time. Despite this, I still love this game for what it is and was my first step into developing public games on Roblox.</p>

            <img src="./crazy-fighting-game-img.png" width="450px" class="right-image">

            <p>Crazy Fighting Game (or just "Fighting Game") was my second attempt at making a game using the Unity Engine, the same engine and language used in Ultimate Boss Fight. This game is one of my favourites and was made in the span of around 4 weeks total. All of the gun models and interface were made within Unity and the objective of the game is to kill as many enemies (the red capsules) as possible. You gain points for getting kills and those points can be spent on abilities, giving you certain bonuses for a limited time. For example, with 25 points you can buy the grenade which will create a small blast radius on collision, killing nearby enemies. Other abilities include a rocket launcher and nuke, both of which will assist in killing enemies. The main mechanic, weapons, are also randomized and will refresh every 10 seconds, giving you a random weapon out of an arsenal of 6 different and unique guns. These guns can range from a basic pistol to a flamethrower or sniper. Another important thing to note is that the main focus of this game, similarly to the boss fight game, was on the programming side of development due to a limited time frame. If this were a real game, I would have spent a lot more time on the visual side than just on the programming side. Finally, you have to stay alive and keep your health up. Running into an enemy or being hit by one will result in a health decrease. When your health hits 0, the game will end. Overall, I had a lot of fun making this game and, being my second game on Unity, is something I will forever be proud of.</p>

            <h2>My Future Plans And Goals</h2>

            <p style="margin-top: 50px; text-align: center;">For the past year, I have been doing a lot of game development using Roblox Studio and Roblox's game engine. Ever since I started playing Roblox, I have always wanted to make a game that people would play, and I am living that dream right now. You get to take on a whole other perspective when you are actually making the games. However, Roblox is fairly limited in what it can do, especially when it comes to memory usage and scripting. Because of this, I do hope to pursue other coding languages or game engines to develop more safisticated games that can house a lot more features. I would like to develop a few more games on Roblox beforehand,  but that is my long term goal. Unity is another game engine that I want to pursue further. My boss fight and shooter games were both made using Unity, and I feel I could do a lot better now with my past year of experience. I may also choose to learn Game Maker to learn a bit more about 2D games, or maybe even Unreal Engine. For now, I am only getting started.</p>
